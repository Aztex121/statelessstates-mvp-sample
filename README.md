## Overview
This repository contains a sample extract from **The StatelessStates™ Project**,  
developed under **Genesis Systems**.  

It demonstrates three foundational security layers:  
- Secure Token Authentication  
- PQC-Ready Interface (Post-Quantum Cryptography)  
- System Hygiene Watchdog ("The Janitor")

## System Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates how requests move through the system:

![StatelessStates MVP Flow](assets/diagram.png)

1. User / Client → initiates request  
2. Secure Token Auth → verifies identity & session integrity  
3. PQC-Ready Interface → applies post-quantum encryption layer  
4. System Hygiene Watchdog ("The Janitor") → monitors, enforces, and cleans system state  
5. StatelessStates Core → trusted execution environment

## Repository Contents
- `auth/` → Secure token authentication module  
- `pqc_interface/` → Post-quantum crypto-ready interface  
- `janitor/` → System hygiene watchdog prototype  
- `README.md` → Project overview (this file)  

---

## Key Features
- Post-Quantum Ready → Future-proof encryption & security  
- Self-Monitoring → Autonomous system hygiene enforcement  
- Layered Security → Zero-trust design from user to core  
- Modular Design → Easily extended into larger StatelessStates™ architecture  

---

## Roadmap
- Integration with QuantumSim for fintech testing  
- Expansion into Genesis Systems' Mother Core  
- Formal compliance review for government & enterprise adoption

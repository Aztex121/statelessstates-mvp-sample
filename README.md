# StatelessStates MVP Sample

![StatelessStates Banner](assets/banner.png)

This repository contains a sample extract from **The StatelessStates Project**.  
It demonstrates three key areas of my work:

1. **Secure Token Authentication** – lightweight implementation with PQC-ready concepts.  
2. **The Janitor** – a system hygiene watchdog for process monitoring, log sanitisation, and intrusion detection.  
3. **Quantum-Ready Interfaces** – early exploration of post-quantum encryption and modular architecture.

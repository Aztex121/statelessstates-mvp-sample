# StatelessStates MVP Sample

This repository contains a sample extract from **The StatelessStates Project**.  
It demonstrates three key areas of my work:

1. **Secure Token Authentication** – lightweight implementation with PQC-ready concepts.  
2. **The Janitor** – a system hygiene watchdog for process monitoring, log sanitisation, and intrusion detection.  
3. **Quantum-Ready Interfaces** – early exploration of post-quantum encryption and modular architecture.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Rust, JavaScript (Node.js), C++  
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenAI API  
- **Security**: Zero-trust models, AES/RSA, PQC concepts  
- **Systems**: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes

⚡ This is a demonstration repository for recruitment purposes.  
Full project remains under development within *The StatelessStates* ecosystem.
